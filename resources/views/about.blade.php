	<p><h3>What is it?</h3></p>
	<p>
		This page is here to answer the bigger questions in life, such as, what is this
		website for, and wha am I ding here? So let me tell you a bit about this website.
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine that you are an Aston student looking for a great time; you could go onto
		Facebook and browse for a fun and exciting event, such as a, lets say Football club... OR
		you could find one right here!!! here you will be able to find events, find out where and
		when they are, you can even show your intrest in an event by liking it!
	</p>
	<p>
		If you don't find any events which intrest you, please dont leave :'( ! Instead, how about
		you show everyone how its done and decide to organise you very own events! Becoming an
		event organiser is fun, easy and best of all free, you will be able to create as many
		events as you want, for anyone and everyone to enjoy.
